## Recognition-of-Empty-Parking-Spaces

#The "Recognizing Parking Spaces" first identifies the maximum umber of vehicles parked in a parking lot. It then saves their coordinates into a list.

#In the Testing, a new frame of the parking lot is imported and then empty spaces on this new frame are marked with red whiile the frames containing a car are marked Green.

#Further:
I intend to include a navigational system which could direct an upcoming vehicle towards an empty parking space.
